## My personal website
**My name is Dan and I love creating the web.**
Take a look at this self promotional project.

### About the design
Everyting is designed by hand, without libraries using scss features.

### About the development process
I have decided to create this project with static HTML and vanilla javascript, so I can showcase the use of these technologies without external libraries and frameworks like React and NextJs. Since I develop the web parallel with low-level applications, I have no problems using bare bone functionality to create something awesome.
In production, I do use React and NextJs.

### About my coding style
I personally prefer snake_case over camelCase or PascalCase, since I have started programming in C. I have no problem transitioning to different formatting, but in personal projects, I follow these C style conventions:
1. **snake_case** for variables, functions and methods
2. **SCREAMING_SNAKE** for constants
3. **PascalCase** for enums and classes/interfaces, but I often just stick to snake_case

*I  personally believe that camelCase is the devil's creation, but I understand if you want to follow JS conventions.*
